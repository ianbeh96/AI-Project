# AI-Project
This project is an Othello game that was made with the intention to create an AI to play the game. The game design is pretty straigtforward, Python turtle was used to come up with a quick platform for the game to run. For the algorithms that was used, Minimax and Alpha Beta search was used to allow the AI to choose moves that it would better its performance.
